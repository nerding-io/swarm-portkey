# Swarm-Portkey Project Presentation Speaker Notes
## Author

## I. Introduction
- This project demonstrates how to combine OpenAI's Swarm framework with Portkey for enhanced API management and observability in multi-agent systems.
- We'll explore the architecture, key features, and benefits of this integration.

## II. Multi-Agent Architecture
- Our system uses a supervisor-worker model.
- The supervisor agent manages the overall conversation and delegates tasks.
- Worker agents specialize in specific tasks: triage, flight booking, and hotel booking.
- Agents can dynamically hand off tasks based on the user's needs.

## III. OpenAI Swarm Implementation
- Swarm allows for context-aware responses, maintaining conversation history.
- We use function calling to integrate external services (weather, flight, hotel APIs).
- Streaming responses provide a more interactive user experience.

## IV. Governance and Observability
- Portkey serves as a unified interface for interacting with AI models.
- It provides advanced tools for control, visibility, and security.
- We can monitor all LLM requests, making our app more resilient and secure.

## V. Evaluations and Annotations
- We can evaluate response quality using Portkey's tools.
- User feedback is integrated to improve agent performance over time.
- This creates a continuous improvement loop for our multi-agent system.

## VI. Portkey Features and Best Practices
- Portkey adds minimal latency (20-40ms) due to edge worker distribution.
- Data security is ensured with encryption and compliance certifications.
- The system can scale to handle millions of requests with 99.99% uptime.
- No imposed timeouts allow for flexible request handling.

## VII. Demo and Results
- Let's look at some example interactions with our trip planner.
- We'll examine the trace visualization to understand agent interactions.
- The metrics dashboard provides insights into system performance.

## VIII. Conclusion and Future Work
- The Swarm-Portkey integration provides a powerful, observable, and secure multi-agent system.
- Future work could include more specialized agents and advanced natural language understanding.
- We welcome any questions about the project or the technologies used.
